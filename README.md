# Tic-Tac-Toe 🎮

This is a simple browser-based **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was created as part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), specifically to demonstrate my understanding of:

* ✅ **Factory Functions**
* ✅ **Module Pattern**
* ✅ **Separation of Concerns**
* ✅ **DOM Manipulation**

## 🚀 Features

* Two-player game (X vs O)
* Detects win and draw conditions
* Option to restart the game
* Responsive UI for desktop

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

This project uses **factory functions** to create player objects and encapsulate data. It also implements the **module pattern** using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) to keep code organized, private, and modular.

## 🛠️ Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Factory Functions & Module Pattern

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
```

## 🔍 Learning Goals

* Practice structuring JavaScript projects using modular design
* Understand how to encapsulate logic and data using factory functions
* Gain experience manipulating the DOM dynamically

## 📸 Screenshot (optional)

*Insert a screenshot here if you'd like to show off your UI*

## 📚 Credits

This project is part of the curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
